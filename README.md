# TF2-Gimmick-Generator

## A Word from U23RN6M3,
This project was created for recommending goofy ahh playstyles, and nothing else. If you encounter someoneone executing a ridiculous gimmick that this program recommended to them, the contributors of this program are not responsible for whatever actions they may inflict on your server, for the fault at hand is the one who followed the program's recommended gimmick. If you have any concerns about the elements of the lists displayed in main.py, or have any suggestions you would like to add to the lists, you may state your problems here(https://github.com/U23RN6M3/TF2-Gimmick-Generator/issues) and I would try to respond in less than a week. Any troll issues or pull requests will likely be revoked/ignored.
